### Setting Up
First we need to install Jest, you can do this by running the following in your command line

```
npm install jest --save-dev
```


Next we want to configure the scripts in your `package.json` file.

```
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Now we need to create a file where we can write our tests. So go ahead and create a file called `server.test.js` in the root of the test folder.

Once you've done that you can move onto the next step.
