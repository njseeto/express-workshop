# Express Workshop - Testing

### What?
You've probably finished the Node workshop and are now wondering how to test your endpoints. Firstly, well done on completing the workshop! Secondly, kudos for wanting to test those new endpoints you've built.

### Why?
Testing helps you write better code. Testing is a great way to make sure your code is doing what it is supposed to do.

It also gives you the confidence to change your code with the knowledge that your tests will tell you if something has gone wrong.

### How?
We will be using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html) and [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).

What is Jest and why are we using it? 
- Jest is a library that tests JavaScript
- It is super easy to setup
- It is used by most companies today

What is Supertest?
- Supertest is a library written to test HTTP requests to a node server (perfect for what we are doing!)
